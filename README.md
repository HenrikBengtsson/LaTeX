----------------------------------------------
As of October 23, 2012, this is the official page for the LaTeX sty files com.braju.pstricks,
com.braju.graphicalmodels, and com.braju.pedigrees.  (They were previously (2004-2012) hosted
at http://www.maths.lth.se/matstat/staff/hb/mypackages/).

For examples of how to use them and what they generate see the *.tex and *.ps files in the
examples/ subdirectories.  Note that com.braju.graphicalmodels.sty and com.braju.pedigrees.sty
both requires com.braju.pstricks.sty.
